# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
Step-by-step guide for implementing comprehensive security measures on your server infrastructure.

## Features
- Automated security hardening
- Customizable security policies
- Multi-layer defense implementation
- Real-time monitoring setup
- Incident response procedures
- Compliance frameworks support
- Audit trail configuration
- System hardening tools

## Configuration
1. Initial Security Setup
   ```bash
   # Initialize security configuration
   ./security/core/secure-server.sh --init

   # Configure basic security policies
   ./security/core/secure-server.sh --configure basic

   # Setup advanced security measures
   ./security/core/secure-server.sh --configure advanced
   ```

2. Monitoring Configuration
   ```bash
   # Configure security monitoring
   ./security/core/security-monitor.sh --configure

   # Setup alert notifications
   ./security/configure-notifications.sh --setup
   ```

3. Firewall Configuration
   ```bash
   # Configure firewall rules
   ./security/firewall/manage-firewall.sh --configure

   # Enable intrusion detection
   ./security/firewall/manage-firewall.sh --enable-ids
   ```

## Usage
1. Security Hardening
   ```bash
   # Run initial hardening
   ./security/core/secure-server.sh --harden

   # Verify security measures
   ./security/core/security-check.sh --verify
   ```

2. Continuous Monitoring
   ```bash
   # Start security monitoring
   ./security/core/security-monitor.sh --start

   # View security status
   ./security/core/security-check.sh --status
   ```

3. Incident Response
   ```bash
   # Handle security incidents
   ./security/emergency-response.sh --incident-type {{type}}

   # Generate incident report
   ./security/tools/analyze-logs.sh --generate-report
   ```

4. Regular Maintenance
   ```bash
   # Update security measures
   ./security/core/secure-server.sh --update

   # Audit security configuration
   ./security/core/security-audit.sh --full
   ```
