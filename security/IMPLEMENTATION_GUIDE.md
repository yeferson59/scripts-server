# Server Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the complete security implementation for the server, including monitoring, alerting, and maintenance procedures.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Security Monitoring
- Location: `security/security-monitor.sh`
- Status: **Active**
- Features:
  - System resource monitoring
  - Failed login detection
  - File integrity checking
  - Process monitoring
  - Network connection monitoring

### 2. Alert System
- Location: `security/notify-enhanced.sh`
- Status: **Configured**
- Capabilities:
  - Email notifications
  - Log file monitoring
  - Alert aggregation

### 3. System Hardening
- SSH Configuration
- Firewall Rules (UFW)
- System Logging
- File Permissions

## Pending Tasks

### 1. Alert Configuration
```bash
# Configure email notifications
./security/configure-notifications.sh

# Test notification system
./security/test-alerts.sh
```

### 2. Monitoring Thresholds
Edit `/etc/admin-scripts/notification.conf` to adjust:
- CPU usage threshold
- Memory usage threshold
- Disk space threshold
- Failed login attempt threshold

### 3. Security Maintenance
Regular tasks to perform:
```bash
# Daily
- Check security logs: /var/log/admin-scripts/security/monitor.log
- Review failed login attempts
- Monitor system resources

# Weekly
- Update system packages
- Review user accounts
- Check file integrity
- Test notification system

# Monthly
- Rotate SSH keys
- Full security audit
- Update security policies
- Test backup restoration
```

## Configuration Files

### 1. Main Configuration
Location: `/etc/admin-scripts/notification.conf`
```bash
EMAIL_ENABLED=true
EMAIL_ADDRESS="your-email@example.com"
ALERT_LEVEL="WARNING"
```

### 2. Logging Configuration
Location: `/etc/admin-scripts/logging.conf`
```bash
LOG_DIR="/var/log/admin-scripts/security"
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=7
```

## Security Scripts

### 1. Monitoring Service
```bash
# Start monitoring service
sudo systemctl start security-monitor

# Check status
sudo systemctl status security-monitor

# View logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/admin-scripts/security/monitor.log
```

### 2. Security Checks
```bash
# Run manual security check
sudo ./security/security-check.sh

# Test alert system
./security/test-alerts.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Email Alerts Not Sending
```bash
# Check Postfix configuration
sudo postconf -n | grep smtp
# Verify email settings
cat /etc/admin-scripts/notification.conf
# Test email manually
echo "Test" | mail -s "Test" your-email@example.com
```

2. Monitoring Service Issues
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status security-monitor
# View recent logs
sudo journalctl -u security-monitor -n 50
# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart security-monitor
```

3. Log File Issues
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -l /var/log/admin-scripts/security/
# Fix permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/log/admin-scripts
# Verify logging
logger -t security-test "Test log entry"
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete email notification setup
2. Configure monitoring thresholds
3. Set up log rotation
4. Schedule regular security audits
5. Document emergency procedures

## Security Contacts

- System Administrator: [Your Contact]
- Security Team: [Team Contact]
- Emergency Response: [Emergency Contact]

## Updates

This guide should be reviewed and updated monthly to ensure all security measures remain current and effective.
